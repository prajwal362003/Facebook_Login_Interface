css should be put in the same line of the html code
eg: <h1 style="color:blue"> Prajwal Kale </h1>


INTERNAL
css should be put in the head section of the html code
eg: <head>
        <style>
            h3{
                color:red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

The tag which you want to modify is called as a Selector
& the block of code inside it is called as a decleration block

<!--Here img is said to be a selector-->

8] What is a difference between a class and a id ? 

 A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page(means a student in a particular class has a single id or roll no )
 To select a class , dot(.) is used and to selct an id hashtag (#) is used
